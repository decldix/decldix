# What is this?

decldix is the central package for the decldix idea aimed at people who like the values of debian and know the advantages of declarative system configuration.

The name is an acronym **decl**arative **d**ebian n**ix** as these are the driving principles behind this project idea.

It is geared towards users who want reproducable debian based setups - workstations or servers.
To archieve this, decldix is based on opiniated principles and workflows:

- centered on a git repository which should be hosted on a public git repository provider as a kind of offsite backup
- low key onboarding experience with provided repository layout and linting
- multi-host and multi-user approach with the possibility to define common and specific settings
- modular service configuration utalizing the native configuration methods of the respective service
- secret management is included

decldix is written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as this language empowers everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
